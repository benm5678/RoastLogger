# RoastLogger

## TODO
- Fix so connect doesn't cleer pinned data
- Show 1 decimal point on temp
- X-data points as dates (or some solution so if we skip the line is smooth in chart)
- Temp alarm should speak periodically [and add Warning: if above]
- Allow to shift pinned chart left/right [till roast start]

- Auto charge/drop detection
